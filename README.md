<h1>Mental Health Website</h1>
<p>This is a web-based platform developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to connect users to mental health doctors in their cities. It also utilizes SQL and PHP for server-side programming to enable dynamic data retrieval and processing, and phpMyAdmin for database management to ensure data integrity and security.</p>
